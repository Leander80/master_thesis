Observing the prompt component of the atmospheric muon flux using IceCube. 

Atmospheric muons are created by the decays of secondary particles generated in comic ray interactions with the upper atmosphere. Based on the muons parent particle it can be categorized into conventional muons originating from pions and kaons and prompt muons generated by the decays of more short lived particles. While the conventional component dominates for lower energies  prompt muons become dominant at high energies of about $1$ PeV and upwards. 
Measuring these muons using the IceCube neutrino telescope is useful to study hadronic interactions at a combination of center of mass energies and rapidities that can hardly be replicated by any current collider experiment. Because of the low overall flux at the energies, at which the prompt component dominates, there has been no analysis to date that has been able to significantly measure it. 

The talk will cover the process of investigating the normalization of the prompt muon flux using a forward fit. This involves testing the methodâ€™s ability to identify the prompt component using simulations as well as the intended subsequent application to actual IceCube data.
